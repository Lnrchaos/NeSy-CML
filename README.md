# 🚀 NeSy-CML: The Neuro-Symbolic Continual Meta-Learning Framework

A cutting-edge AI framework designed to solve complex reasoning problems with unparalleled efficiency. NeSy-CML integrates deep neural perception with verifiable symbolic logic, challenging the 'scale-is-all-you-need' paradigm of current Large Language Models.

---

## 🔥 Revolutionary Architecture: Efficiency Meets Intelligence

NeSy-CML is a **modular, hybrid AGI research platform** engineered to combine the strengths of four critical AI domains into a single, highly accessible system.

| Core Component | Functionality | Key Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NeuroSymbolic AI** | Blends neural networks (for fast pattern recognition) with symbolic controllers (for logic, planning, and constraint enforcement). | **Interpretability & Reliability:** Provides verifiable reasoning, moving beyond the "black box." |
| **Continual Learning (CL)** | Uses Adaptive Replay Buffers and Meta-Learning to enable the system to **learn new tasks rapidly** and continuously without forgetting previous knowledge. | **Lifelong Learning:** Accelerates skill acquisition while preventing catastrophic forgetting. |
| **Modular Design** | Allows independent development and upgrading of specialized modules (e.g., symbolic reasoning, memory). | **Scalability & Debugging:** Simplifies governance, verification, and porting to new domains. |
| **Multimodal Integration** | Combines Text, Image, and Structured data understanding. | **Contextual Understanding:** Enables true cross-modal reasoning. |

## 🏆 Achievements: The $0.16 \rightarrow 0.92$ Triumph

The performance shift in the Chess Model is the core validation of the Neuro-Symbolic design, proving the framework prioritizes **reliable reasoning** over trivial accuracy.

### Chess Reasoning (Deep Strategic Analysis)

| Metric | Simple Task (Original) | Complex Task (Current) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | $\text{98\%}$ | **$\text{\textasciitilde} 83\%$** |
| **F1 Score (Reliability)** | $\text{\textasciitilde} 0.1 \text{-} 0.2$ | **$\text{\textasciitilde} 0.92$ (Massive Leap!)** |
| **Complexity** | 10 Basic Multi-Labels | **10 Main Labels + 58 Sub-Labels ($\text{6X}$ Data)** |

**Analysis:** The low F1 score of the original 98% accuracy model showed it was brittle and unreliable (only guessing easy moves). The current **$0.92$ F1 Score** proves the NeSy-CML architecture successfully converted the problem into a deep, hierarchical reasoning task, demonstrating **robust, multi-level strategic understanding** even on minimal hardware.

### Other Model Achievements

* **Multimodal Integration**: 88.5% accuracy combining multiple data types (Files Pending)
* **Poetry Generation**: To be determined accuracy on style classification and creative analysis (Files Pending)
* **Programming**: To be determined accuracy on code analysis and pattern recognition (Files Pending)

IMPORTANT NOTE ON LATEST RELEASE (Oct 23, 2025): Thank you for the massive initial interest!
I am actively restructuring the training files folowwing recent upgrades. The core 
architecture files are stable, but a lot of the main training scripts are currently broken
due to how many times I had to optimize and improve to ensure that they worked on a 
4GB GPU so that more developers could have access. Also there seems to be dataset issues,
I will get to the bottom of that at some point today and figure out what keeps stalling
the train_chess_improved.py file. Of course, the training files were just to be examples 
to prooof of work that this framework does indeed work. I plan to make some test files 
for things like XOR test among other tests to ensure and show that the model is in fact
what I have said it is. Again, Thank You all for your huge support and I hope that this 
project becomes the face of the next generation AI models, I can see great things in it 
and I'm just hopeful the rest of you do to.

🙏 Acknowledgments: Built on the power of the PyTorch framework and designed by a self-taught programmer (Lyle Richards II) to accelerate the future of open science.

Afterthoughts: I will eventually get something up for potential tipping of some sort that will go as funds towards my research in AI and Quantum computing. It is kind of hard to do things like this when lacking the funding for the research and the development time so any help is much appreciated. If anyone chooses they can tip whatever they feel led to tip at my paypal lylerichards17@gmail.com. Thank you all and I hope that everyone enjoys the new framework!
