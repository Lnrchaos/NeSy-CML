# Model Distribution Strategy

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

### **GitHub Repository:**
- ✅ All source code
- ✅ Training scripts  
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Requirements
- ❌ No model weights

### **Model Weights Distribution:**

#### **Option 1: Hugging Face Hub (Best)**
```python
# In your README.md
## 🚀 Pre-trained Models

Download our trained chess model:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

# Download the model
model_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="your-username/chess-neuro-symbolic",
    filename="best_chess_model.pt"
)
```

#### **Option 2: GitHub Releases**
```markdown
## 📦 Pre-trained Models

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/chess-neuro-symbolic/releases)
2. Download `best_chess_model.pt` from the latest release
3. Place in your project directory
```

#### **Option 3: Cloud Storage**
```markdown
## 🔗 Pre-trained Models

Download trained models:
- [Chess Model v1.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/your-file-id) (83.94% accuracy)
- [Poetry Model v1.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/your-file-id) (if available)
```

## 📋 **Updated .gitignore**

```gitignore
# Model weights and checkpoints
*.pt
*.pth
*.pkl
*.h5
*.onnx
checkpoints/
models/
weights/
saved_models/

# Training data

```

## 🎯 **For Your Chess Project**

### **What Users Get:**
1. **Clone your repo** - Gets all code instantly
2. **Install dependencies** - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Either:**
   - Train their own model with their chess books
   - Download your pre-trained weights separately

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Fast repository cloning
- ✅ Clean version control
- ✅ Users can choose to train or download
- ✅ Professional open-source practice
- ✅ No GitHub storage limits

## 📝 **README Section to Add**

```markdown
## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Use Pre-trained Model
1. Download our trained model: [Chess Model v1.0](link-here)
2. Place `best_chess_model.pt` in project root
3. Run inference: `python evaluate_model.py`

### Option 2: Train Your Own
1. Add your chess PDFs to `dataset/Chess_data/`
2. Run training: `python train_chess_improved.py`
3. Wait 2-4 hours for training to complete

**Training your own model is recommended for best results with your specific chess literature!**
