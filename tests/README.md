Some of these test files are going to be broken, as the code grew and certain bugs were worked out made some test files obsolete,
however, I am just going to do an entire project file dump and then sort through the code here on github and try to fix the broken
files so that everything is useable. maybe some of the test files will come in handy as templates for future projects who knows.
